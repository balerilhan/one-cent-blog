  Are single precision floats faster than double precision floats on 64 bit CPUs? I changed my raytracer's implementation to find the answer.

After my last [post](/2017/12/01/exploring-simd-in-rust.html) exploring SIMD instructions in Rust I was curious about the performance implications of `f64` vs `f32` values. My raytracer uses `f64` values for all floating point calculations. If it was not clear from the last post my knowledge of low level CPU performance is limited at best. With that said I would not expect `f32` to be any faster than `f64` on modern 64-bit CPUs since you can do `f64` calculations with a single CPU cycle anyway. In the benchmark mentioned in the previous post I tested the performance between `f64` and `f32` and found no difference.

I had some interesting discussion and feedback on the SIMD post that convinced me to try the `f32` switch anyway. So I did and I then benchmarked the results.

## Methodology

I rendered the above scene featuring the [Stanford Bunny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_bunny) 10 times on my Macbook and desktop computer with both [f64 floats](https://github.com/k0nserv/rusttracer/commit/a2a8ff29197025d1dccffb6c14c41320d0c2927d) and [f32 floats](https://github.com/k0nserv/rusttracer/commit/03bd02facc7766a944cf4f339f5170dba80b03ef). All tests were ran on the latest Rust nightly. My desktop computer runs Windows 10 and my Macbook runs macOS Sierra.


## Results

It turns out `f32` is about 30% faster in both these cases presumably because of more efficient CPU cache usage and potentially because there's more opportunity for effective [pipelining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_pipelining) in the CPU. For this project I do not expect I will need the precision offered by the double precision floats in `f64` so I've decided to keep the `f32` change.

The reason this simple scene is so slow on both computers is that I have only implemented very rudimentary acceleration structures.
